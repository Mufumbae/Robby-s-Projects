    <p><a>Love ya, viewer!</a></p>

It was quite fun and I thrououghly enjoyed having a fun time both creating it and coding it. I eseically had fun cracking it though! :) </p>

    <h2>Custom Computer</h2>
    <p><a href="https://www.esports.net/betting/sites/gg-bet">Fortnite Gambling?</a></p>
    <p> I made a custom computer and it works so that is pretty cool. I took apart laptops to construct it and made a working computer for the best parts. I shorted a motherboard which was fun. I custom made 3d printed pieces and 3d modeled the case which I then laser cut out of wood. Nick Hernandez is your average person living his own life on Earth, while being a Fortnite gamer at the same time. One day, he woke up in a whole new fantasy world, with gaming abilities from Fortnite. Shapeshifting (Changing Skins), Building, you name it. Probably with no way home, he sets off to learn more about this world he’s in. </p>

    <p> This was one of the first applications I had made on Snap and I am very proud of it. It is a place to write dwon your taks and make sure you are ready for the upcoming days! With the app you can modify the list, remove items, look for items, and add items to the list. The pleasaqnt backgroud also adds to the very awesome expereince! </p>
